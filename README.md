# Blog App â€” a basic app I built to learn AngularJS

A simple blog with a that uses localStorage instead of a remote back end so I could focus on learning AngularJS client side.

---

The app was built using the Yeoman AngularJS generator - http://yeoman.io/

First you will need to install Node.js then `npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower`

Clone this repo then run `npm install && bower install` in the project directory to install the dependencies.

There is partial unit & e2e test coverage.

`grunt test` is configured to stay running and watch files for changes.

You can access the e2e tests on the test server at http://localhost:9001/e2e/runner.html
